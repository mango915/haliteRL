    "The training so far has been decent but not satisfactory at all. The evidence of that is that the reward function is not monotonic in the number of epochs, hence a sub-optimal strategy has been adopted.\n",

    "has a better performance than the trained model. At the same time we can see that the passages through the shipyard at first they increase and then they saturate between 45 and 60. With an average reward of 6000+ this makes roughly more than 100 of halite deposited for each passage. This is comprehensible since the ship cannot distinguish between 101 and 1000 of cargo, hence every time it goes over 100 of cargo it has learned to go back to the shipyard.\n",

    "This was the most promising agent, since at first had learned to deposit on average around 8000 of halite in 40 passages, hence 200 of cargo for each passage. This is a strange value, because if we assume for semplicity the cargo to be either equal to 100 or to 500, it means that 25% of the times was depositing 500 of halite and the other 75% of the times 100 of halite. In other words it was a peak, but not a stable configuration. At the final level we have on average roughly 42 of cargo for each passage, meaning that it was always in the lowest state of cargo. This is of course a very bad thing.\n",

    "\n",
    "It seems that there are two problems at work here: one is that somehow for the ship is convenient to go back to the shipyard even with the smallest amount of halite and the other one is that this problem is coupled with the fact that the quantization levels of the halite prevent the ship from exploiting efficiently its halite levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sure we could try ad infinitum at designing the halite levels in order to get better results, but this would increase the performance without solving some core issues of the learning. Instead we can tackle these issues in a simple and elegant way."

    "## Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give a more negative baseline for the reward when depositing halite, in order to discourage too many loops (better few but of quality).\n",
    "2. Encode the halite carried with more levels, in order to reduce the stochasticity induced by the quantization of the halite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first improvement is gratis in terms of algorithmic complexity, whereas the second one if we increase of just one level the cargo quantization we get an increase of $\\frac{4}{3}= 133\\%$ of the state compexity, that is completely managable."

Also we decoupled the threshold for the halite in the cells of the map and those for the halite carried. The idea is that the space complexity scales linearly with the quantization levels of the halite carried, whereas if we were to change all the quantiazion levels together it would have been a polynomial dependence of the 6-th order (e.g. from 3 to 4 levels would have made the task the 562% more complex instead of the 133% with just the increase in the cargo levels)."

    "\n",
    "As you can see, this time the agent has learned to be patient enough to wait until having a cargo of 800 before returning back to the shipyard. \n",
    "\n",
    "We think that, even though with some tricks the performances of the agent could be boosted, the task is qualitatively solved for a single agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some future developments are:\n",
    "1. Scaling to multi-agent system (we will probably reduce the number of turns in an episode in order not to finish the halite and maybe also increase a bit the map size to have more space of maneuver).\n",
    "2. Using DeepQ-learning to go beyond tabular methods both in generality and in performances. The most annoying thing of tabular methods is the fact that they do not really understand the space of the game and they just encode it categorically; this is of course the greatest limitation of this method.\n",
    "3. Find some efficient way to use the symmetry of the problem at our advantage. Potentially we could have 8x of the experience with the same number of epochs and this could also help the algorithm to be much more stable.\n",
